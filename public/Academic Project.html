    <h1>Academic Project</h1>
    This showcase 3 of the selected academic projects during my university, which believe best representing my technical
    skillsets.

            <h2>Infrastructural Ecotone Next Generation Airport</h2>
            <h3>RMIT major project 2016</h3>
            <p>
                This is an experimental project that explores what happens to the city and border condition when you
                inject
                large infrastructural processor into
                dense urban environment.
                In responding to the above questions, I am proposing an architecture that operates at both urban and
                building scale, has this blurred spatial
                relationship, concurrent access from all different sides instead of the traditional rigidly bifurcated
                sequential experience into the building; multiple
                trajectory throughout the building; complex event flow in terms of how people move through for different
                type of events; control of access visual or
                physical permeable; circulation space becomes sport events accommodated</p>

            <h2>Layering Mentone Suburban Multi-Use Residential</h2>
            <h3>RMIT design studio project 2016</h3>
            <p>
                As an alternative to the traditional top down planning, the project adopts the strategy
                of superposition and layering of uses, proposes the modified suburb house as a source of
                regeneration that provides new housing stock whilst absorbing activities within its new
                type and urban fabric.</p>
            <p>
                Shopping centres are a hybrid civic space where more than shopping can happen; they
                are the core of a suburban village. This hybrid is achieved by the containment of retail
                space, engaging socially with community life and forcing a more dispersed flow of
                interaction.</p>

            <h2>Pheromone Contouring Robotics Research</h2>
            <h3>RMIT design elective project 2015</h3>
            The project explores autonomous systems for real time robotic fabrication, which seeks to imbue physical
            material with a new digital agency using real time robotic control and computer vision systems. There are 3
            main branches of development that have came from our body of work: stigmergy as environmental feedback,
            the slow robotics paradigm and expanded vision systems.
